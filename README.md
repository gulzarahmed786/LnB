# Project Title: **Damage Detection Application**

## Description
This project is designed to detect and manage damages efficiently using advanced methodologies. It provides a robust interface for users to upload and analyze data, coupled with a database to store and retrieve information seamlessly. The system is tailored for businesses aiming to automate damage detection and reporting processes.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for uploading data and initiating analysis.
- Advanced damage detection algorithms.
- Integration with a relational database for data persistence.
- Comprehensive visualizations for results and insights.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ 
- Required Libraries: Install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` (if available) or as listed in the codebase.
- Database: A MySQL or PostgreSQL server to implement the schema provided in `db_schema.sql`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Set up the database:
   - Use the SQL file `db_schema.sql` to create the necessary database structure.
   - Update database credentials in the application configuration.

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the application interface.
2. Upload the necessary files for analysis or input required data.
3. View results and export reports as needed.

## Visualizations
Screenshots and graphical insights are included in the folder **"visualization of project"**. These visuals provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's output.
